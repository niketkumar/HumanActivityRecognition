For the above data, R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Please modify top two lines of run_analysis.R to provide root folder containing data sets and output file name to write
tidy set into: rootFolder and tidySetFile.
